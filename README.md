This is a simple HTML, CSS and XML based website for a bookshop. The main page contains general information about the bookshop, such as the address, contact details, and opening times. The page includes a paragraph, a list of book genres, and a table for the opening hours. A list of books are retrieved from the XML data structure - DTD and XSLT used for formatting.
